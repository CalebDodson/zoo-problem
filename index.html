                    Bears are large and powerful mammals. They have sharp claws that they use to dig, climb, and catch prey. Bears are omnivores, so they consume a wide variety of foods, from plants, such as berries, to small animals like fish. Bears are typically solitary and need ample space with an exception for mothers and their cubs. Observing and interacting with bears requires caution, especially when they are protecting their cubs or eating.

                    Giraffes are easily identifiable with their long necks and legs that help them tower over all other land animals. Their diet requires a large amount of fiber and they use their height to achieve this by reaching leaves high up in trees. They are generally gentle in nature, but when threatened can deliver powerful and deadly kicks. Giraffes are social and usually live and move in groups.

                    While much larger than the typical house-cat, lions are a member of the feline family. They don't share size in common with their house-cat family members, but they are heavy sleepers, sleeping 16-20 hours a day. Their yellow coats help them blend into their habitats which helps them hunt as they are carnivores. Lions are social animals and live in groups called prides.

                    Monkeys, like humans, are primates. They have opposable thumbs, dexterous fingers, and tails that help them hold onto branches which helps them climb. Monkeys are highly social and engage in social behaviors such as grooming, playing, and vocalizing. Most monkeys are omnivores and mostly eat fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals.

                    Alligators are a member of the reptile family and sport large teeth, strong jaws, and powerful tails. Their color is usually dark green to help them blend in to the waters in which they inhabit. Alligators are carnivorous and feed on fish, birds, and other small animals. Alligators are territorial and solitary, so interns should maintain a safe distance.
